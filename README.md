INTRODUCTION
------------

The goal of OWNER API is to minimize the code required to handle
application configuration through Java properties files.

Full documentation available on [project website][website].

BASIC USAGE
-----------

The approach used by OWNER APIs, is to define a Java interface
associated to a properties file.

Suppose your properties file is defined
as `ServerConfig.properties`:

```properties
port=80
hostname=foobar.com
maxThreads=100
```

To access this property you need to define a convenient Java
interface in `ServerConfig.java`:

```java
public interface ServerConfig extends Config {
    int port();
    String hostname();
    int maxThreads();
}
```

We'll call this interface the *Properties Mapping Interface* or
just *Mapping Interface* since its goal is to map Properties into
a an easy to use piece of code.

Then, you can use it from inside your code:

```java
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ServerConfig cfg = ConfigFactory.create(ServerConfig.class);
        System.out.println("Server " + cfg.hostname() + ":" + cfg.port() +
                           " will run " + cfg.maxThreads());
    }
}
```

But this is just the tip of the iceberg.
